###old model
Model file name is model{number}_{makehuman-topology-name}{total-vertices-count}_bone{bone-number}.js
Model001 is almost default Makehuman 1.0 just changed 100% Caucasian & 100% female.
the name is like proxy or female is topology name on makehuman.

but female-topology model is modified for bone-animation with blender.

after that I t-posed with makehuman's tools.more detail see here.

total-vertices-count is total vertices count.
I merged body and eye,in option some model has cloth.

and texture is packed because of right-now only single geometry works.

bone-number is just bone numbers because of second-life-xxx is seems long name.
